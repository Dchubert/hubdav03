Week 1 Goals: 
Learn the basics of The Ruby programming language
Research options for buying/building Arduino boards
Brush up on Google Sketchup

Week 1 Goals: 
Learn the basics of The Ruby programming language - Met. The code is no longer an incomprehensible wall, but I'm still 
working to remember the various commands.

Research options for buying/building Arduino boards - Exceeded. Most of my time has been devoted to this, I've gone over the entire 
Arduino Workshop book in liue of the other reading but will catch up.

Brush up on Google Sketchup - N/A. My group has decided to not use Sketchup in lieu of something more compatible with a 3d 
printer.
