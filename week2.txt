Week 1 Goals: 
Learn the basics of The Ruby programming language - Met. The code is no longer an incomprehensible wall, but I'm still working to remember the various commands.
Research options for buying/building Arduino boards - Most of my time has been devoted to this, I've gone over the entire Arduino Workshop book in liue of the other reading but will catch up.
Brush up on Google Sketchup - My group has decided to use in Sketchup in lieu of something more compatible with a 3d printer.

Week 2
Continue learning Ruby
